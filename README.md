Sung Jin-Woo Skin for Amp

Thanks to NeonRain for the character!

ARISE and conquest the hardest dungeon: Petrichor V. He comes with his Sword but no shadows came this time.

Also, my music pack contains Dark Aria for one boss battle. Good luck finding it ;)

I'm also planning for another skin If I can find a dual dagger character that works.
